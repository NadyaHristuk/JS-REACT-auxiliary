00:00.090 --> 00:04.570
You need to add in some scoring into the game as well as a way to end the game.

00:04.620 --> 00:06.840
So we know that we've got once we've got a collision.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.650
That's when the game is over.

00:08.670 --> 00:13.470
So starting out with the scoring let's update and add in the score for the game.

00:13.470 --> 00:18.930
We've got already got a score element on the page and we've already connected it to a value of score

00:19.230 --> 00:21.480
and within the player setup.

00:21.720 --> 00:25.910
I'm also going to set up a value of score set as default.

00:26.160 --> 00:33.570
And then when we start the game what I want to do as well is take that value and set it to Player Score

00:33.630 --> 00:35.450
is going to be equal to zero.

00:35.450 --> 00:38.070
So this is our starting position of the game.

00:38.070 --> 00:44.640
So once the game is in play every time we loop through I want to update the score.

00:44.640 --> 00:48.000
So every time we're do running through that function play game.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.160
Before we conclude I want to update the score.

00:51.270 --> 01:00.160
So let's add that value in so that's Player Score and we're going to increase it by 1 and then using

01:00.160 --> 01:08.080
the score object we're going to update that inner text of that element to equal whatever the value of

01:08.080 --> 01:09.990
Player Score is.

01:10.000 --> 01:10.690
So try that.

01:10.840 --> 01:17.470
And we see that we've got our score calculating their ad in a little bit of styling for that score.

01:17.470 --> 01:22.070
So background color and we'll set that background color to be black also.

01:22.090 --> 01:23.610
Let's set up a height for that.

01:23.650 --> 01:31.450
So height of and text align center text align that value and also we need to actually see the score.

01:31.450 --> 01:34.170
So let's update the color of the score to be white.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.560
So there we've got our score value.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.200
And that's always increasing.

01:40.450 --> 01:46.450
And we can also update that to say score to make it more evident what it is that we're putting there.

01:46.720 --> 01:58.090
So as we're playing the game score and increasing the player's score else you're going to make the text

01:58.180 --> 02:01.160
a little bit bigger as well.

02:01.360 --> 02:09.020
And of course you can style this as needed so just some default styling.

02:09.270 --> 02:18.200
And also I was like to add in the font family so we could then as fantasy so we've got our escort score

02:18.290 --> 02:20.050
ever increasing in value.

02:20.510 --> 02:24.830
And then once we hit the collision that's where we want to stop the game let's stop all of the gameplay

02:26.800 --> 02:31.030
and we do have a function in order to handle the end game.

02:31.270 --> 02:32.530
So let's create that.

02:32.550 --> 02:35.160
So end game function.

02:35.200 --> 02:42.230
So we've got our hit and at this point we want to end the game so when we start the game ending the

02:42.230 --> 02:45.620
game is going to be fairly opposite to that.

02:45.620 --> 02:57.470
So we're just going to build that down here where we've got the start button so function and game generate

02:57.470 --> 02:58.910
that end of the game.

02:59.600 --> 03:10.980
So player start is now going to be false so it's going to stop the looping and we've got that animation

03:10.980 --> 03:14.100
frame so it's going to stop it from continuously looping through.

03:15.570 --> 03:19.420
So try that and make sure that we do have a way of ending the game.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.190
So that's our essentially our game ending part there.

03:23.190 --> 03:37.720
We can also update our message so our score and in our HD Himmel can say game over and I do a line break

03:37.720 --> 03:43.020
their score was and then whatever the value of score is going to be.

03:43.350 --> 03:46.690
And that's again hold held in Player Score.

03:46.800 --> 03:50.050
So we've got our score score was 1 0 4.

03:50.290 --> 03:51.420
And game over.

03:51.430 --> 03:54.010
So we've got all of the messaging that we need.

03:54.190 --> 03:58.750
I'm gonna make this a little bit bigger because it looks like it's running out of the overlap there.

03:58.750 --> 04:03.880
So the score again although just that slightly and sometimes that is the case where you do need to make

04:03.880 --> 04:06.470
adjustments at.

04:06.490 --> 04:13.060
So now what I want to do is I want to add the ability to start the game once again and we can do this

04:13.060 --> 04:20.790
in a number of ways that we want to have the ability to initiate again a brand new start screen and

04:20.790 --> 04:28.260
I'm going to create a button in order to accomplish that so we can add that into our score area or we

04:28.260 --> 04:35.400
could simply add that on top of I'll take our start screen that we hid when we press the start button

04:36.850 --> 04:46.370
and instead of hiding it we're going to remove that class of height so we'll have our start screen once

04:46.370 --> 04:46.650
again.

04:48.110 --> 04:55.110
So once we have our collision we get our welcome message again and I want to update some of the styling

04:55.110 --> 04:56.470
for that.

04:57.010 --> 05:04.950
I do a margin auto so that it centers the content and for that we also need a width as well.

05:04.950 --> 05:06.830
So it's set it to 300 picks.

05:06.870 --> 05:11.870
Try that at welcome message and see what happens we'll get a collision.

05:11.870 --> 05:12.470
So there we go.

05:12.500 --> 05:20.610
We've got our welcome message again sharks showing up there instead a welcome message.

05:20.800 --> 05:21.490
And so there we go.

05:21.520 --> 05:29.430
So we've got all of our gameplay and all of our score and our information being output into our so go

05:29.430 --> 05:36.200
in and add this end game function into your game and we should also have a way to start the game again.

05:36.300 --> 05:39.270
And as you can see it's not really starting well.

05:39.360 --> 05:44.730
So that means that we need to remove quite a few elements when we hit the start game just to make sure

05:44.730 --> 05:46.990
that everything is emptied out.

05:47.010 --> 05:51.990
So going into our start game and we're gonna take care of this in the upcoming lesson so that we can

05:51.990 --> 05:57.900
actually restart the game by clicking the button and we've got a few things that aren't working exactly

05:57.900 --> 05:58.690
as needed.

05:58.710 --> 06:01.090
So to take care of those in the upcoming lessons.

06:01.110 --> 06:01.850
So it's still to come.
