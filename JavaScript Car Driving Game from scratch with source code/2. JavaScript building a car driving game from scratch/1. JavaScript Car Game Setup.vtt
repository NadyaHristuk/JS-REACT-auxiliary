00:00.100 --> 00:01.240
Welcome in this lesson.

00:01.260 --> 00:07.110
It's going to be about building out our each male structure so that later on we can incorporate all

00:07.110 --> 00:11.970
of the gameplay that is necessary in order to produce our application.

00:11.970 --> 00:18.030
So starting out we're going to create a div that's going to be a mean div calling it giving it a class.

00:18.030 --> 00:19.910
We're going to sign a score there.

00:19.920 --> 00:24.180
So this is where we can output whatever the score values are that we want to show.

00:24.210 --> 00:30.660
Also setting up another class and we can give this one on class of game and then within here we can

00:30.660 --> 00:33.360
show all of the gameplay creating one more dip.

00:33.390 --> 00:41.910
So inside of the data the game class div can create a div and this will be the start screen and then

00:42.240 --> 00:47.520
here is where we can have all of the welcome message and start button.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.270
And so on.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.040
So we'll add that in as well.

00:50.040 --> 00:58.210
Next creating a class and adding to this class we're gonna call it game area.

00:58.290 --> 01:01.650
And so this is where all of our gameplay will take place.

01:01.740 --> 01:08.480
So we're gonna swap between the start screen and the game area once we start the game.

01:08.520 --> 01:14.850
I'm also going to create a basic class I'm going to call it height and this is going to have one property

01:14.870 --> 01:21.570
where we're gonna use display none so that way we don't show both of those and we can add and remove

01:21.690 --> 01:26.560
the hide class as needed in order to show different screens to the player.

01:26.610 --> 01:33.750
Next we're going to use javascript to connect to our elements on the page and within the start screen

01:34.500 --> 01:36.400
we're gonna add in an event listener.

01:36.420 --> 01:41.100
So when the user presses the start screen it can start the game as well.

01:41.100 --> 01:48.570
So selecting the various elements that we have on our page are going to use const and for the score

01:48.720 --> 01:53.310
area using the document and query selector.

01:53.310 --> 02:00.480
We're going to select the element with score and output that into the javascript score object selecting

02:00.540 --> 02:06.300
our start screen using document query selector.

02:06.690 --> 02:13.790
We're gonna select the element with a class of Start screen you don't have to call them the same you

02:13.790 --> 02:16.580
could call them something different as well.

02:16.670 --> 02:22.580
And next stop selecting our game area and that's going to call it the same thing so that we have some

02:22.580 --> 02:28.350
consistency query selector and selecting that element with the class of game.

02:28.370 --> 02:33.800
So once I've made these selections I usually like to double check and make sure that we are accessing

02:33.800 --> 02:37.500
them properly so opening up your developer console.

02:37.610 --> 02:45.020
We can type in score we see that we access that div type in Start screen so that we access that's div

02:45.380 --> 02:51.860
and then game area just to make sure that we're accessing the right divs so that coming up next we can

02:51.860 --> 02:57.290
focus on the javascript and create all of the interactions that are gonna be necessary in order to produce

02:57.350 --> 02:58.760
the gameplay.

02:58.760 --> 03:03.950
So one last thing that we wanted to add in before we conclude and that's adding in an event listener

03:03.950 --> 03:07.610
to start screen and this is going to be a click event.

03:07.730 --> 03:12.770
So whenever the player clicks the start screen where we've got that welcome message this is going to

03:12.770 --> 03:18.570
trigger off the game start and adding in a function call it start.

03:18.570 --> 03:22.790
So this is where all of our gameplay will start and we'll take a look at that and we'll build that out

03:22.850 --> 03:24.340
in the upcoming lessons.

03:24.410 --> 03:33.470
So go ahead and setup your default H2 AML add in classes as necessary within the styling and then use

03:33.500 --> 03:40.010
javascript to add all of those elements as objects usable objects within your code so that you're ready

03:40.010 --> 03:43.790
to move on to the next step and then also test out that click event.

03:44.240 --> 03:48.270
So that makes sure that that is functioning and the way to do that.

03:48.320 --> 03:55.340
Usually I put a console message into that function so I know that whenever I'm clicking it it is being

03:55.340 --> 03:56.970
invoked and it is working.

03:57.110 --> 04:00.560
So go in and add that into your project and be ready to move on to the next step.
