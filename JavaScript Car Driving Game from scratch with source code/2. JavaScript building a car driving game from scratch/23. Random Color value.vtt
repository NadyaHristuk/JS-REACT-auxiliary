00:00.610 --> 00:04.930
So as we're generating out the enemies we can also generate a random color.

00:05.010 --> 00:08.420
So we're gonna add in a function that's going to generate that random color.

00:08.530 --> 00:14.600
We can just call it random color and we want to return back random hex values.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.500
So we're returning back and with hex.

00:17.650 --> 00:23.440
We need to do the hash in front of it for the color and we're going to run several functions to integrate

00:23.440 --> 00:30.010
these functions that are generate generate out the value of a random hex value.

00:30.910 --> 00:37.890
So creating a function we can call it function c we only need a t to use it within the random color.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.530
We're going to call to this value.

00:40.530 --> 00:49.950
So creating out our hex value using math and math random and you'll see that online there's several

00:49.950 --> 00:50.940
different ways.

00:51.060 --> 00:54.770
And there's actually some shorter ones as well to generate random colors.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.730
This one's a little bit easier to explain.

00:57.300 --> 01:03.940
So we see that we're generating a random number from 0 to 255 and we know all of those digits.

01:03.940 --> 01:10.650
So if we do an RG B color that should be 0 to 255 and what we want to do is watch transform this to

01:10.890 --> 01:13.050
a string value to a hex value.

01:13.050 --> 01:16.320
And the way that we do that is we do two string sixteen.

01:16.380 --> 01:20.820
So that's going to convert our decimal number to a hex number returning back.

01:20.820 --> 01:24.960
And as we know with colors we get F F E and so on.

01:24.960 --> 01:30.890
So those give us that 255 0 to 255 in a string value.

01:31.170 --> 01:36.530
And there's one other thing that we do need to take care of before we return this value.

01:36.630 --> 01:44.760
And that's in case we end up with only a one digit number within our hex value for the colors.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.380
We're gonna need all six characters.

01:47.400 --> 01:54.750
So this is to make sure that in case our hex value turns out to be only one character we're going to

01:54.810 --> 01:58.920
use a substring value of minus two.

01:58.930 --> 02:05.130
And you can use this for numbers as well to make sure that you do get instead of If You Go Down Under

02:05.130 --> 02:09.480
10 you're only gonna have one digit there if you want two tickets then you can do this as well.

02:09.510 --> 02:16.500
So this will always make sure that you're returning back a value of at least two characters two digits.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.450
So we've got our zero that we're placing in front of it.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.730
And if we need to use it.

02:20.940 --> 02:27.090
So zero plus the string value of hex which is this one we've generated up here.

02:27.090 --> 02:32.640
And if this one is two characters then it's only going to return back the last two characters if it's

02:32.640 --> 02:38.040
one character then it's going to still return back the last two characters but we're dropping a zero

02:38.040 --> 02:39.010
in front of it.

02:39.090 --> 02:45.690
So now that we've generated a random color we can update this value to be random colors and you'll see

02:45.690 --> 02:50.700
that now we're generating random colors for those enemy cars.

02:50.880 --> 02:58.980
Also we need to apply that into where we're generating the items as well so whenever they run off of

02:58.980 --> 03:02.030
the page and this is another one of those optional things.

03:02.030 --> 03:06.430
So if it runs off the page we can generate a random color for it.

03:06.450 --> 03:08.860
So assigning a different color value to it.

03:08.910 --> 03:13.770
And again this is another one of those optional things that we don't have to add but we can add if we

03:13.770 --> 03:23.870
want to of course also within the enemy you can add in value in the inner H2 AML and you can set a value

03:23.870 --> 03:27.710
of X if you wanted to so we could do X plus 1.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.100
So you know what card number it is.

03:30.260 --> 03:37.010
And then going back into here if we have any text in here we can make this really big so we can do font

03:37.490 --> 03:49.400
size and set that to be two and also get rid of that name car as we're generating out our car we don't

03:49.400 --> 03:51.890
need to to write car on it of course.

03:51.890 --> 03:58.310
So as we generate this out we can get rid of this line here that's writing out the inner text for that

03:58.580 --> 03:59.210
for our.

03:59.390 --> 04:03.140
So you can see now we've got the cars they're going to have numbers on them.

04:03.140 --> 04:07.970
So one two three and then we're going to have one coming back and so on.

04:08.000 --> 04:16.680
So going back let's also or we'll do a text align and center text along and also vertical line so align

04:16.700 --> 04:18.130
it to the middle.

04:18.260 --> 04:19.070
So see how that looks.

04:19.130 --> 04:23.310
And if we wanted to as well we could add in a space there.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.110
So a line break.

04:24.560 --> 04:28.550
So where we've got that in our H2 Mel because it is H2 Mel.

04:28.550 --> 04:29.700
Of course.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.520
So that we'll move it down one.

04:31.550 --> 04:36.770
So let's try that game out and we'll work through any of the final bugs that we have within the game

04:36.820 --> 04:42.960
and the application in the upcoming lesson so that's still to come as well as we can make them look

04:42.960 --> 04:47.070
a little bit more like cars as well within the CSA us if we wanted to.
