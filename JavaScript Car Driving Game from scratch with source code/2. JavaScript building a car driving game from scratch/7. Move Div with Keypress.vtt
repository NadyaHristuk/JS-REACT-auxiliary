00:00.360 --> 00:01.130
Welcome back.

00:01.130 --> 00:03.560
And this is the lesson you've all been waiting for.

00:03.570 --> 00:08.820
Where we're going to make some out something happen on screen we're going to take our car that we're

00:08.820 --> 00:13.320
creating that div that we've just created and we're gonna move it around on the screen so the few things

00:13.320 --> 00:18.110
that we need to add and prepare for adding it in as a position absolute.

00:18.180 --> 00:26.010
So of course with CSX position absolute gives us the ability to provide left top coordinates for the

00:26.010 --> 00:28.170
positioning of an element.

00:28.170 --> 00:30.410
We can also position it from bottom.

00:30.420 --> 00:31.650
So do that.

00:31.650 --> 00:39.590
And for now we're going to set bottom to be 100 pix and we'll also position our left position.

00:39.750 --> 00:43.640
So our left position by default will be 200 picks.

00:43.830 --> 00:48.900
Also going to take the opportunity to set a width of this particular element.

00:48.900 --> 00:56.550
So setting the width of the element to be and setting the height of the element to be 150 picks.

00:56.730 --> 00:58.230
Also background color.

00:58.230 --> 01:00.440
So what's on adding in content here.

01:00.510 --> 01:04.530
So we'll have our little blue car and I think I'm actually going to make this a little bit smaller.

01:05.070 --> 01:10.590
And now next what we want to do is add that class into the element that we just created.

01:10.590 --> 01:14.490
So where we've got our car that we created in the last lesson.

01:14.490 --> 01:18.740
This is a car object of the div that we're creating dynamically.

01:18.780 --> 01:24.300
We're going to use set attribute an attribute that we're setting is a class so you can do this.

01:24.300 --> 01:29.910
If you don't have any classes already added to that element you can just set a default class in the

01:29.910 --> 01:32.970
class setting and be setting is car the one that we just created.

01:33.000 --> 01:33.660
Let's try that.

01:34.030 --> 01:41.180
So there's our blue dot or blue square and we want to ultimately now move that around the page.

01:41.370 --> 01:44.460
So see that that's fairly long and big car.

01:44.460 --> 01:49.290
I'm going to make this smaller because I do have the screen zoomed in so I can zoom out a little bit

01:49.290 --> 01:52.670
on the screen so that it's a little bit more manageable.

01:52.710 --> 01:57.100
And while that is a long car so don't want to make it a limo or anything like that.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.360
So I'm going to shorten that a little bit.

01:59.370 --> 02:05.910
There's our car and we want to move this element around depending on what keys are being pressed and

02:05.910 --> 02:11.010
where did he have the play game function operating that we set up in the earlier lesson.

02:11.010 --> 02:19.050
So now it's a matter of determining what key is pressed and updating that element position so selecting

02:19.110 --> 02:24.340
our element we've got our request animation so it can keep that at the end.

02:24.540 --> 02:32.130
And now we need to apply some conditions and within our conditions we're going to check to see the value

02:32.220 --> 02:35.670
of keys so using that key object.

02:35.670 --> 02:41.580
We've got several option objects there so we've got a key up to selecting the element using the document

02:41.640 --> 02:47.570
object query selector and we're selecting the element with a class of car seats so that we just created.

02:47.580 --> 02:48.710
So now that we have it.

02:48.720 --> 02:53.160
So we need to also add in to our x and y coordinates.

02:53.160 --> 03:00.120
So taking the player object we're gonna have a value for y going to increment this value with for now

03:00.150 --> 03:02.050
let's do a value of five.

03:02.160 --> 03:09.120
And we can also set a value we can set a speed value there and then we can use that speed in order to

03:09.120 --> 03:11.860
control how fast where element is moving.

03:11.910 --> 03:17.070
And as we're building it out we're gonna grab the x and y coordinates of this particular object so arrow

03:17.070 --> 03:23.260
down is going to decrease that arrow left is going to update the player position.

03:23.430 --> 03:25.860
So decreasing the x coordinates.

03:25.860 --> 03:30.060
Arrow right is going to increase the x coordinates.

03:30.060 --> 03:34.470
So we've got a variable that we're tracking in the background that's going to be player X and player

03:34.470 --> 03:34.980
y.

03:35.130 --> 03:38.280
And I'll show you how to add that as well into our object.

03:38.850 --> 03:50.280
And so as we're generating the car we can take our player x value and set it by calculating where the

03:50.310 --> 03:54.240
car object is and getting its offset position.

03:54.420 --> 04:03.170
So we can get its offset left position and we need to do that after and then player y value is going

04:03.170 --> 04:09.060
to be car and we're going to use offset top position and we'll console log.

04:09.150 --> 04:12.660
The value of players so that we can see what the value here is.

04:12.660 --> 04:17.850
So when we start the game preset some value you can see that all the way up here that we're setting

04:17.880 --> 04:22.180
the value of x to two hundred and y two to eighty.

04:22.200 --> 04:27.150
And this is actually going to correspond with the positioning of this particular element that we know

04:27.210 --> 04:32.250
which key is being pressed we can adjust the position of that particular element.

04:32.250 --> 04:41.610
So now it's a matter of taking the car and updating that element style updating its left position to

04:41.610 --> 04:52.680
be equal to player x plus so that those are always matching and we'll take also player style and top

04:52.680 --> 05:00.810
position and equal that to player y plus picks and you can also double coat those as well.

05:00.930 --> 05:01.650
So let's try that out.

05:02.310 --> 05:09.500
So now when I press my arrows up and down and actually down is moving it up.

05:09.720 --> 05:14.880
So we need to adjust that that up and down.

05:14.890 --> 05:17.420
So that was a little bit of an adjustment there.

05:17.440 --> 05:25.450
So now whenever I press and I can move up arrow down arrow left right I can also move them together

05:25.450 --> 05:31.300
at the same time and have multiple combinations of movements so that you can create an element that

05:31.360 --> 05:36.190
moves around on the page depending on what arrows are being pressed.

05:36.190 --> 05:41.390
So coming up next we need to extend on the gameplay so go ahead and add this into your project.

05:41.470 --> 05:48.580
Try it for yourself and it's a matter of tracking those positions and then we can update them over here.

05:48.670 --> 05:54.820
And it's if we need to make some additional updates to these values that's why I kept them separate

05:55.090 --> 06:00.460
because we could have as well tracked the position current position of car but I usually find doing

06:00.460 --> 06:05.020
it this way is a little bit more easier and it's a little bit more clear as to what's happening and

06:05.050 --> 06:06.190
easier to read.

06:06.190 --> 06:11.770
So that's why I introduced that second variable under player where we're setting that value to wherever

06:11.770 --> 06:16.170
that particular element is located off the offset left and offset top.

06:16.300 --> 06:20.560
And then I'm introducing that positioning so that both of those match.

06:20.620 --> 06:26.830
And we're updating the player X and player y position instead of the car position directly.

06:26.830 --> 06:28.360
So go ahead and add this into your project.
