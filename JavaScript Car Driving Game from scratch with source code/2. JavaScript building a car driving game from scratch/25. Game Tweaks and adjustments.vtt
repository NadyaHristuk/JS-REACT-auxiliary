This lesson we're going to update some of the styling to improve what the way the game looks so within

00:06.180 --> 00:08.760
our car and as well as our enemy.

00:08.790 --> 00:13.410
We're going to apply a background image and the image is going to have a U URL.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.930
And within this you url.

00:15.030 --> 00:22.760
So we actually have an image car to PSG so you can apply that and the background is going to be cover.

00:22.830 --> 00:26.200
So suit that looks like it's now when we refresh.

00:26.210 --> 00:26.430
OK.

00:26.430 --> 00:32.190
They look a little bit more like cars now as well you can add that image as well into your application

00:32.430 --> 00:34.760
to make them look a little bit more like car like.

00:34.760 --> 00:42.150
So I was just a little quick tweak to adjust the way the cars look and let's do a final code review

00:42.210 --> 00:45.570
of the game just to make sure that everything is working as intended.

00:45.870 --> 00:49.620
So when we start the game we come in and we've got a really narrow road.

00:49.800 --> 00:54.990
So we might want to even adjust the width of the road if we wanted to as we can see it's a little bit

00:55.020 --> 01:00.330
narrow and sometimes light look a little bit better if the road was wider.

01:00.330 --> 01:04.330
So instead of 200 picks let's do a width of 400.

01:04.410 --> 01:08.400
And in this case we're probably enough to make some adjustments to the code as well.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.550
Let's try it out and see how that works.

01:10.650 --> 01:15.260
And we do need to adjust where the lines are as well as where the cars are coming in.

01:15.360 --> 01:21.050
So you can make it a little bit more difficult but then this as well we need to adjust because we hardcoded

01:21.330 --> 01:22.910
some of these values.

01:23.010 --> 01:25.310
So we've got our margin left.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.750
So we need to adjust that to be one ninety five.

01:28.860 --> 01:36.090
And we also need to adjust where the car position is as we've got that to be as a static position as

01:36.090 --> 01:36.390
well.

01:36.960 --> 01:42.920
So if we update all three of these we should be good to go with having a wider road.

01:43.200 --> 01:48.050
So go back and try that out and see if that works.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.880
And so far so good.

01:50.010 --> 01:53.330
It shouldn't be affecting any of other mechanics of the game.

01:53.370 --> 02:00.490
So we should be able to start again and see that that is that is working properly.

02:00.490 --> 02:05.410
And sometimes you do need to play through these games just to make sure that everything is working as

02:05.410 --> 02:06.330
intended.

02:06.580 --> 02:12.850
And we might not even want to change our car color to be white so that it stands out a little bit more

02:12.850 --> 02:13.860
within the road.

02:13.870 --> 02:19.540
So that's another option so you can eat really easily adjust the car color and that's coming in from

02:19.600 --> 02:26.080
as a default here within these lines we've got it as blue so we can set it as white or we could use

02:26.080 --> 02:27.820
javascript to set that as well.

02:27.820 --> 02:30.160
So it's all dependent on what you want to do.

02:30.300 --> 02:35.930
So now we've got our white car and all of that the enemy cars are going to have a number on them.

02:35.930 --> 02:38.800
So we see that it's got the one two three and so on.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.190
So see they all have numbers on top of them.

02:42.190 --> 02:48.940
So do try out the game and an upcoming lesson we'll do a quick overview of the source code to do a quick

02:48.940 --> 02:54.610
review of what we did and how we accomplished and built out this car game from scratch.

02:54.820 --> 02:57.310
So all of that is still yet to come in the upcoming lesson.
