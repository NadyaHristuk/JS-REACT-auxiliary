This lesson we're gonna do a quick C assess update on the start screen to make it more effective and

00:05.100 --> 00:11.010
look a little bit better as right now it's kind of in line there and it's pushing down where the road

00:11.010 --> 00:13.020
is so it doesn't look the best.

00:13.290 --> 00:19.590
So if we use a position absolute we can float it above the road again using a background color so we

00:19.590 --> 00:22.460
need to wait to kind of stand out so we'll make it red.

00:22.470 --> 00:27.660
I'm going to update the width to be 50 percent so that's dynamic there.

00:27.810 --> 00:34.630
So that way when I do a margin or a left position I can use 25 percent left.

00:34.740 --> 00:42.400
And also we can set a top so we can set a default top of 100 a color for the font so that two white

00:42.660 --> 00:48.150
and we're going to also need to use z index to make sure that it's actually going to show up on top

00:48.150 --> 00:48.880
of the road.

00:48.930 --> 00:50.840
So let's see what that looks like.

00:50.940 --> 00:54.660
And now when we hit start and we generated again.

00:54.660 --> 00:59.940
So now it's just popping up on top and this looks quite a bit more effective and much better.

00:59.940 --> 01:03.720
You can also update the font family if you wanted to as well.

01:03.780 --> 01:07.330
So if you would do something a little bit more interesting so try that one more time.

01:07.380 --> 01:09.210
It stands out a little bit more as well.

01:09.210 --> 01:15.360
Press here to start and arrow keys to move if you hit a red car you will lose.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.770
So we need to update that because we updated the color.

01:17.820 --> 01:21.570
So if you hit another car you will lose.

01:21.570 --> 01:24.000
So this was just a quick lesson to fine tune it.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.760
And of course you can style it and color it and update it as needed.

01:29.760 --> 01:35.650
I'm also going to decrease the size of the fonts so do a one point seven.

01:35.790 --> 01:39.750
And also so that we can do a line height.

01:39.750 --> 01:46.600
So this will affect where the positioning of the Linus and adjust it slightly.

01:46.620 --> 01:48.090
So make it thirty five.

01:48.120 --> 01:52.000
I'm trying to move the numbers more centered on top of the car.

01:52.110 --> 01:54.830
And as you can see that's a little bit more centered.

01:54.870 --> 01:58.170
We can move them down slightly as well to maybe 38.

01:58.450 --> 02:03.860
So now we've got the numbers showing up on top of the car and that's actually where we wanted to.

02:03.930 --> 02:09.060
So a few minor adjustments have some fun with that play around with the C assess to make a game look

02:09.060 --> 02:10.510
fantastic.

02:10.620 --> 02:12.510
So coming up next we're going to do the code review.
