00:00.210 --> 00:04.510
We've created a way to end the game but we don't have a great way to restart the game.

00:04.710 --> 00:10.650
So we see that once we we get the restart content but we're generating a new car and there's quite a

00:10.650 --> 00:15.150
few things that are happening there that we don't actually need happening within the page.

00:15.150 --> 00:20.220
And that's because our game area we're generating a bunch of stuff that's already existing.

00:20.220 --> 00:26.460
So I want to select game area and update the inter H2 Mel and just simply remove out all of the content

00:26.700 --> 00:28.350
that's been available there.

00:28.350 --> 00:35.790
I'm also going to be removing out the height of the gameplay as we don't need that anymore because we

00:35.790 --> 00:38.010
actually do want to see the road in the background.

00:38.010 --> 00:40.430
So let's try that out and refresh it.

00:40.710 --> 00:43.800
And when we hit start let's see what happens.

00:43.920 --> 00:49.320
And now we can hit start again and we're able to start the game once again and we can always restart

00:49.350 --> 00:55.020
the game because now we're zeroing out what we're building out within the gameplay so we're not adding

00:55.020 --> 01:00.900
any extra cars and we're not adding to the confusion of what's happening within the gameplay so we need

01:00.900 --> 01:05.500
it to always clear out and reset it back to its initial state.

01:05.550 --> 01:12.450
So just quickly go through that and you can see that we're setting that animation frame we're creating

01:12.450 --> 01:13.130
the car.

01:13.260 --> 01:19.470
So all of this is being done and it's resetting basically all of the parameters of the game and rebuilding

01:19.470 --> 01:22.400
all of the elements that we're using within the gameplay.

01:22.470 --> 01:27.750
So by clearing it out and setting the inter H to Mel to blank that's essentially clearing everything

01:27.750 --> 01:33.510
out and we already have the player content here so the players start and Player Score is already added

01:33.540 --> 01:34.320
in there.

01:34.350 --> 01:39.460
So those are the two parameters that we also need to reset in order to create the gameplay.

01:39.510 --> 01:43.450
So now that we've generated that we can update some of the styling.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.380
And coming up next we'll do a final run through.

01:46.380 --> 01:51.780
And one of the things that I did say that I want to add in is the ability to generate random colors

01:51.780 --> 01:54.090
for the bad guy cars.

01:54.090 --> 01:57.290
So let's set that up and I'll show you how to do that.

01:57.450 --> 02:03.360
And we go into our functions and we need a weight where we're setting it to red.

02:03.360 --> 02:08.890
We need a way to generate a different color for those cars.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.560
So I'll show you how to do that.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.720
And that's just an extra.

02:11.750 --> 02:15.760
So you don't have to do that all of the gameplay is still there but I'll show you how to do that.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.130
An upcoming lesson that's a quick bonus less instead of red.

02:19.170 --> 02:20.370
It'll be random color.
