00:00.090 --> 00:06.450
This is the second part to getting the lines moving so as we see we've got lines on our road but they're

00:06.450 --> 00:07.070
not moving.

00:07.140 --> 00:11.460
So we need to get them moving and the way that we're gonna get them moving is within the play game.

00:11.550 --> 00:18.360
We've got a number of options that we can move them along so we can setup a loop here or we can create

00:18.360 --> 00:20.370
a function to move the lines.

00:20.370 --> 00:25.980
So I prefer to create a function that's going to move the lines so we can invoke that and have that

00:26.070 --> 00:29.570
completely separate of the movement of our car.

00:31.270 --> 00:37.720
So setting up that function that's going to move lines we need to use query SELECT for all and select

00:37.720 --> 00:39.640
those elements as an object.

00:39.640 --> 00:46.120
And we created those elements with a class of line an object called lines using document.

00:46.360 --> 00:52.210
In this case we're using query selector all because once like all of the elements with the class of

00:52.210 --> 00:58.510
line and then we can loop through all of those elements let's loop through the lines object.

00:58.510 --> 01:04.510
So this is a node list and we can use the for each to loop through each one of those items creating

01:04.510 --> 01:08.060
a function and we can grab those by using item.

01:08.710 --> 01:12.160
And we're going to need to have a variable for its y position.

01:12.160 --> 01:18.790
So just as we set it for the car we can also set it for our line as well.

01:18.820 --> 01:25.780
So as we're generating out those lines we can take that element and we can give it a y position and

01:25.780 --> 01:35.330
that y position will be whatever the value of x times 150 is so that's its starting position of Y and

01:35.330 --> 01:38.320
then we can use that value of y.

01:38.360 --> 01:45.230
So as we're looping through we can see console log item and we can see a value of y for each one of

01:45.230 --> 01:46.340
those items.

01:46.370 --> 01:48.840
So just make sure that it is working.

01:48.980 --> 01:56.150
So you see that we've got all of those value of Y's and we can do a condition to check if item Y is

01:56.210 --> 01:58.680
greater than 750.

01:58.880 --> 02:07.310
And if it is then we're going to reset the value of item y to be zero or we're going to actually set

02:07.370 --> 02:12.620
the value of y to minus 750.

02:12.740 --> 02:25.030
And then what we need to do is we need to set the value of item style top to be equal to item y plus

02:25.120 --> 02:25.740
picks.

02:25.750 --> 02:38.130
So just as we did before and then we take item item y and we're going to increment it by the value of

02:38.130 --> 02:39.330
player speed

02:42.060 --> 02:43.070
let's see how that looks.

02:43.070 --> 02:44.480
So start that up.

02:44.930 --> 02:48.190
And actually this is reversed because we're adding to it.

02:48.200 --> 02:53.060
So we're not setting an equal plus if we do it that way then it's always going to be five and the same

02:53.060 --> 02:58.010
with this one here we need to minus minus the 750 off of it.

02:58.010 --> 02:59.540
So it's a refresh.

02:59.540 --> 03:05.010
And so now we see that we've got these lines that are running and they're running all the way down.

03:05.050 --> 03:09.270
So we actually need to do a little bit something a little bit different as well for this.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.770
So maybe let's subtract even more off of it.

03:12.770 --> 03:14.450
So we can do a thousand off of it.

03:15.710 --> 03:16.850
Try that one more time

03:20.410 --> 03:21.990
just create some additional lines.

03:22.020 --> 03:23.430
So create 10 lines.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.550
And so it's going to be a max width of fifteen hundred.

03:26.550 --> 03:29.070
And so now start checking for 750.

03:29.070 --> 03:33.850
Let's check for max of fifteen hundred.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.920
Now we've got all of the lines showing up

03:40.330 --> 03:43.000
and we also have our car moving.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.190
So we've got it moving across the line.

03:45.190 --> 03:49.570
So notice that's on top of the lines because we added that element afterwards.

03:49.570 --> 03:54.340
So go ahead and add in the lines for your road and coming up next.

03:54.370 --> 03:58.320
We need to create some cars that are going to be obstacles within the game.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.010
Let's still to come in the upcoming lessons.
