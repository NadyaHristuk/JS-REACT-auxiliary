00:00.720 --> 00:03.840
In this lesson we're going to add in some road lines.

00:03.900 --> 00:08.300
First of all going into our CSX Let's create that line.

00:08.550 --> 00:13.770
We're going to position the line absolute just as we did with the car because it's going to sit on top

00:13.770 --> 00:17.400
of the road and background color of the line is going to be white.

00:18.020 --> 00:24.330
So now we need to add the lines into our page and move them along as the road is moving along.

00:25.300 --> 00:29.960
So we've got our car and getting rid of these console messages.

00:30.010 --> 00:33.370
So now we can focus and track on the lines themselves.

00:33.370 --> 00:40.120
And I want to have the lines moving down the center of the page so as we start the game this is where

00:40.120 --> 00:45.940
we can generate the lines and then add them dynamically onto the page.

00:45.970 --> 00:52.090
So just before we build out the car so the car can go on top of the lines we're going to build out the

00:52.180 --> 00:54.390
different lines on the page.

00:54.610 --> 00:59.380
So creating a loop setting X to zero looping while x is less than five.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.240
But we create five lines so it can break out of our loop.

01:02.320 --> 01:08.440
And then here is where we're going to create those divs using what we did before with document create

01:08.890 --> 01:13.540
element an element that we're creating as a div we're going to add a class to the div.

01:13.540 --> 01:18.130
So using that div object we can this time we can do class list to have something different.

01:18.130 --> 01:24.040
Class list add and we're adding the value of line and then we need to set a position of it.

01:24.070 --> 01:27.910
So this is the default position of we're repositioning the line.

01:28.060 --> 01:35.890
So setting that up to be and just as we added in positions here for a style top position we can do the

01:35.890 --> 01:37.750
same thing for the line.

01:37.750 --> 01:39.230
So style top.

01:39.270 --> 01:47.380
So let's set the top position to X times so we're generating out all of the different lines there and

01:47.380 --> 01:49.740
then setting them as picks.

01:49.810 --> 01:55.330
And then lastly we need to append them to our game area.

01:55.330 --> 02:00.400
So just with as we did with the car we're going to upend the line to those.

02:00.430 --> 02:01.200
So try that.

02:01.420 --> 02:02.890
So welcome message.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.850
And we get a bunch of lines there.

02:05.110 --> 02:08.380
So they're not exactly being positioned center.

02:08.380 --> 02:11.680
So we need to make sure that they are being positioned center.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.560
So going back to where we set the positioning.

02:15.750 --> 02:25.110
So instead of margin auto we'll do margin left and we know the road width is 200 picks our width is

02:25.140 --> 02:26.070
10 picks.

02:26.070 --> 02:27.930
So I'm gonna divide that in half.

02:27.930 --> 02:32.820
So that's going to give us a left margin of ninety five picks.

02:32.850 --> 02:35.960
So now we've got our lines for the road.

02:36.060 --> 02:39.100
Got five of them there need to create more you can create more as well.

02:39.420 --> 02:45.930
And we need to get them moving so the next lesson we're going to continue to build out the lines and

02:45.930 --> 02:49.290
we're going to have them moving as the game is looping.

02:49.470 --> 02:54.240
And as you guessed it we're going to place it within the animation frame where we've got the play game

02:54.570 --> 03:02.650
and this way we can select all of those elements with the class of line and update their positions.

03:02.670 --> 03:08.540
So that's still to come in the next lesson so go ahead and update add in the sea assess for the line

03:09.080 --> 03:14.870
generate them once we hit the start button and I'll show you how to get them moving in the next lesson.
