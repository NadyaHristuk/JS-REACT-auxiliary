Welcome to our javascript course where I've got a really exciting project for you.

00:05.940 --> 00:09.320
We're going to be building out a card game from scratch.

00:09.330 --> 00:14.960
This is a sample of the game that we're going to be building where you've got to avoid the other cars.

00:15.030 --> 00:16.480
Otherwise your game is over.

00:16.500 --> 00:20.830
So try to score as much as possible without hitting any of the other cars.

00:20.850 --> 00:25.260
A lot of the content that we're going to be building out is going to be generated via javascript.

00:25.260 --> 00:30.540
My name is Lawrence and I'm going to be instructor for this course and one of the main things that students

00:30.600 --> 00:37.140
often ask me is that they want to have a really interesting project in order to practice their javascript

00:37.140 --> 00:37.880
skills.

00:37.890 --> 00:43.530
This is what I've created for you in the upcoming lessons and I do encourage you to work alongside the

00:43.530 --> 00:49.410
lessons of the course try the code out for yourself to really get familiar with the functionality that's

00:49.410 --> 00:55.200
available in the upcoming lessons we are going to be covering how to generate and create elements on

00:55.200 --> 00:55.900
the fly.

00:56.010 --> 00:59.400
Also how to create and listen for event listeners.

00:59.400 --> 01:06.540
So moving different elements over anywhere within the page using JavaScript and listening for a key

01:06.540 --> 01:07.090
process.

01:07.090 --> 01:12.690
So right now impressing the different keys and pressing the arrow keys on my computer and that's giving

01:12.690 --> 01:15.540
the ability to move car element the white one.

01:15.540 --> 01:21.600
Another important part of what we're going to be showing you is how to create and check for collision.

01:21.660 --> 01:26.550
So almost any game that you're creating socially if it's these visual ones that there's interaction

01:26.820 --> 01:30.870
you need to check to see if there's collision between two different elements.

01:30.900 --> 01:35.250
So that's going to be a key component of what we're going to be generating and how we're going to be

01:35.250 --> 01:41.640
playing this game that it is checking to see if there's collision between the elements on the screen

01:41.820 --> 01:44.050
and if there is then the game is over.

01:44.100 --> 01:50.850
We're also going to be looking at how we can apply our animation screen in order to continuously loop

01:50.850 --> 01:56.060
through the functionality as well as create a smooth animation of movement.

01:56.310 --> 01:59.960
So all of this and a whole lot more is included in the course.

01:59.970 --> 02:04.950
So I know you're excited to get started so let's dive right in and start building out this application

02:05.010 --> 02:05.970
from scratch.
