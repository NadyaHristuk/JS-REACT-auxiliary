It's going to be a quick lesson on my developer setup so not coming lessons.

00:04.380 --> 00:09.000
You're going to see that I've got my editor opened on the left hand side and the editor that I'm using

00:09.000 --> 00:15.690
is brackets and I've got my browser open on the right hand side and the browser that I'm using is chrome.

00:15.690 --> 00:21.500
So we do need a way to create our index dot each time I'll file as well as to see it rendered out.

00:21.630 --> 00:26.750
If you are looking to use the same editor that I'm using you can download it's open source available

00:26.820 --> 00:27.330
brackets.

00:27.330 --> 00:31.770
I oh it's Adobe product it's pretty good editor if you already have one that you're familiar with.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.750
You can go and use that one as well.

00:33.750 --> 00:36.840
So the editor it doesn't really matter which one you use.

00:36.840 --> 00:41.490
We're just simply writing in the front end code and rendering out in the browser the browser that we

00:41.490 --> 00:43.000
are using is chrome.

00:43.020 --> 00:48.840
Most browsers will have some format of developer tools what developer tools do is they give you a ability

00:48.840 --> 00:54.660
to communicate debug your application and communicate between the code that you're rendering out and

00:54.720 --> 01:02.040
the browser window in order to open up dev tools in chrome on a markets command Option C on Windows

01:02.040 --> 01:08.250
machine it's control shift C or you can go ahead and click three dots in the top right hand corner more

01:08.250 --> 01:14.250
tools and then select developer tools and that will open up this window that I'm going to have open

01:14.400 --> 01:16.060
throat upcoming lessons.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.720
There are some prerequisites to this course.

01:18.780 --> 01:25.350
So having a solid understanding of each HTML and c assess is important as we're not going to be covering

01:25.350 --> 01:31.860
that and this is just supplemental in order to produce a better looking application prerequisite to

01:31.860 --> 01:33.870
this course is javascript.

01:33.900 --> 01:40.380
So having a fundamental core understanding of javascript is a prerequisite to the upcoming lessons as

01:40.380 --> 01:46.830
they are focused on building out an application and applying javascript and you should be familiar with

01:47.460 --> 01:54.840
setting variables interacting with the DOM creating functions adding conditions and essentially the

01:54.840 --> 01:57.630
core fundamentals of javascript.

01:57.630 --> 02:02.910
So it is highly recommended that you have that before you begin the upcoming lessons.

02:02.910 --> 02:04.860
Source Code is also included.

02:04.860 --> 02:08.330
So after each lesson I'm providing source code of that lesson.

02:08.430 --> 02:12.860
So you can copy and paste it in your own editor and run the code try it out for yourself.
